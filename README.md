PGN Tools

This is a command-line tool which looks for all available .pgn files in a folder and allows the user to combine them into one.


Fixes to be made

At this time, the user will need to edit ‘init.rb’ to set the PGN_DIR variable to an appropriate address.



Future feature possibilities

-Option to include .pgn files contained within a folder's subfolders.
-Option to make custom .pgn sets from several folders which aren't necessarily nested in each other.


This tool is very useful if you are an online chess player who keeps a lot of .pgn files for analysis purposes.  It is especially useful if you have them categorized into several folders, i.e. "My Games As White", "My Games As Black", and perhaps within those folders a subfolder for each opening system you play or encounter.
